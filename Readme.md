# Scopium

## What this is supposed to be

A framework for writing scope-based eslint rules. Or just a bunch of eslint rules.

## ESLint TypeScript custom rule

This is an example of an ESLint custom rule written with TypeScript

### How to test it

- Run `yarn` to install the dependencies
- Run `yarn workspace eslint-plugin-custom-rule build` to build the custom plugin
- Run `yarn workspace app lint` to see the errors from the custom rule

### Example with fix

- Switch to the branch [with-fix](https://github.com/vinassefranche/eslint-typescript-custom-rule/tree/with-fix) on this repository
